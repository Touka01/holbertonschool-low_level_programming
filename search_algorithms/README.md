# Search Algorithms in C

This directory contains implementations of various search algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms are commonly used to find specific elements within a collection of data. The code in this directory serves as a resource to learn about different search techniques and their implementation in C.

## Introduction

Understanding search algorithms is crucial for every programmer, as they provide efficient ways to locate specific elements within a dataset. This directory aims to present different search algorithms and their implementation in C. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate C file and is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the algorithm's logic and steps.

## Search Algorithms

The following search algorithms are included in this directory:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Each algorithm has its own C file within the directory, containing both the algorithm implementation and an example usage. You can explore each algorithm's file to understand its working and analyze its time complexity.
